Currently, users don't see each other's changes until they refresh the page, there's no indication of who else is viewing a document, and cursor positions aren't shared. The system must support GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket, track user presence per document, broadcast cursor movements in real-time, and handle connection lifecycle properly. Core logic should be in src/resolvers/, src/pubsub/, and src/services/.",
