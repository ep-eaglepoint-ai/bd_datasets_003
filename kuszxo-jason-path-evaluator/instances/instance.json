            "problem_statement": "A configuration management system stores settings in deeply nested JSON structures and needs to extract values using path expressions similar to JSONPath or JavaScript property access. The team tried using string splitting on dots but ran into issues with array indices, escaped characters in property names, and paths that traverse arrays of objects. They need a robust parser that handles expressions like "users[0].address.city" or "config['special.key'].values[*]".
The existing implementation fails on edge cases including numeric string keys that look like array indices, property names containing dots or brackets, empty arrays in the middle of a path, and null values that should propagate rather than throwing exceptions. The team wants clear error messages when paths are invalid or when the JSON structure does not match the expected path.",
