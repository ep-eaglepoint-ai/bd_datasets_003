            "problem_statement": "Design a thread-safe resource management system in Java that coordinates access to a finite set of shared tools among concurrent workers. The system must implement a strict priority-based acquisition protocol where higher-priority tasks can preempt or force 'trades' with lower-priority tasks. The critical challenge is to implement this logic while mathematically guaranteeing freedom from deadlocks (circular waits) and livelocks, without using a single global lock that serializes all operations.",
