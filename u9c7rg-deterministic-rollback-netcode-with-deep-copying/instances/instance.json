            "problem_statement": "n fast-paced multiplayer games, inputs arrive late. To maintain a responsive game, the server cannot wait; it predicts forward. When the real input arrives (e.g., "Player jumped 5 frames ago"), the server must "Rewind time," change the past, and "Replay" history. The Memory Trap here is Pointer Aliasing. If the GameState contains pointers (e.g., []*Entity), a naive model will copy the slice header but not the underlying structs. When the rollback logic modifies the entity's position during re-simulation, it accidentally overwrites the saved history in the ring buffer, destroying the integrity of the timeline. The model must implement a true Deep Copy or use value semantics strictly.",
