# EditPage Standalone

This is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript project containing the `EditPage` component from your workspace with Tailwind CSS enabled.

Quick start:

1. Open a terminal in this folder:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Admi n\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder (2)\editpage-standalone"
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`.
- The `EditPage` component uses Tailwind-style classes; with Tailwind running the UI will match expected styling.

If you want I can also run `npm install` for you or add a basic sample video to `public/` to try the editor immediately.
