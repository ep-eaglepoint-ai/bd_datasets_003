            "problem_statement": "The objective is to implement a dynamic middleware utility for a Python-based API Gateway that optimizes payload compression in real-time. The system must balance server-side CPU availability against client-side network latency to select the most efficient compression algorithm (Brotli vs. Gzip) and compression level, ensuring optimal throughput and reduced data costs without overwhelming the host infrastructure.",
