            "problem_statement": "Build a TypeScript module that converts raw, inconsistent system actions into a clean and reliable audit trail for an internal admin platform. Upstream actions may be missing fields, use different actor formats, have inconsistent timestamps, or provide partial before/after data. Despite this, the audit output must always be deterministic, standardized, and safe for compliance reviews, investigations, and “who changed what” history.

The module must normalize actor identity and timestamps, generate stable event IDs (no randomness), produce clear human-readable summaries, and extract structured field-level changes for UPDATE actions when usable snapshots exist. Actions that cannot be processed must not be silently dropped  they must be returned separately with clear, structured reasons.",
