Return each edge as [u, v] with u < v and sort the result first by smaller node index, then by larger. Use Tarjan’s algorithm: maintain discovery times disc[u] and low-link values low[u] to detect bridges. Correct low-link updates are crucial: for child v, use low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]); for back edges, use low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v]).",
