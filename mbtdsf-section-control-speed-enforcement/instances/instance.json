            "problem_statement": "Point-to-point speed enforcement (Average Speed Check) is mathematically simple but operationally difficult. The mathematical trap is the Haversine Formula: converting degrees to radians and handling the Earth's radius correctly (km) is a common failure point for models that hallucinate simple Euclidean distance (), which is inaccurate for geospatial coordinates. The operational trap is Unbounded State Growth. In high-traffic systems, tracking "Entry" events without a cleanup mechanism for vehicles that exit the highway prematurely leads to a memory leak that grows linearly with traffic volume. The solution requires a "Stale Session" scavenger to delete records that have exceeded the maximum possible travel time for the section.",
