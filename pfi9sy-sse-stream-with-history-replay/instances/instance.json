            "problem_statement": "Real-time streams are fragile. When a client disconnects (e.g., WiFi toggle), the connection breaks. The EventSource API handles the reconnection automatically, but the Server is responsible for filling the data gap. A naive server implementation simply adds the new client to the "Active Pool" and waits for new events. This causes Data Loss: any events that occurred while the client was disconnected are never sent. The engineering solution utilizes the Last-Event-ID header (standard in SSE Protocol) to slice the history array and "Fast-Forward" the client to the present state before pushing new live data.",
