            "problem_statement": "You are a Software Engineer at a consulting firm with 100 employees processing 1,000 expense submissions/month. Current email-based reimbursement takes 3-4 weeks from submission to payment, has 30% categorization error rate, and 15% receipt loss. Finance spends 40 hours/week manually entering data from email attachments, validating expenses, and tracking approvals across spreadsheets. Build automated expense tracking with structured approval workflow (Employee → Manager → Finance → Payment), secure receipt storage with image upload, real-time status tracking, and automated reporting. Implement full-stack application with Go Gin, PostgreSQL, React with Ant Design, MinIO, Docker processing 100+ concurrent submissions without data loss, enforcing approval sequence, generating monthly reports with < 2s query time.",
