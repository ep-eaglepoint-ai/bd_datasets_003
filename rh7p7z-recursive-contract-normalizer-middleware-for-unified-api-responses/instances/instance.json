            "problem_statement": "Our internal API Gateway currently forwards responses from multiple legacy microservices that expose inconsistent data contracts. Naming conventions vary between snake_case, camelCase, and PascalCase, date formats are inconsistent, and sensitive PII fields may leak beyond internal boundaries. This forces frontend and mobile clients to implement repetitive, error-prone transformation logic.
The goal is to build a Contract Normalizer middleware that recursively transforms all outgoing responses into a consistent corporate API format: camelCase keys, ISO-8601 timestamps, and strict removal of sensitive fields. The solution must be immutable, handle deeply nested structures and arrays, and safely manage circular references without crashing or mutating input data.",
