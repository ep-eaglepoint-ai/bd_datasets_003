            "problem_statement": "mplementing a bounded pool requires blocking when the limit is reached. The difficult part is handling Timeouts. If 10 goroutines are blocked waiting for a connection and one of them times out (Context Deadline), the pool must remove that specific waiter from the queue. Naive implementations using simple buffered channels often fail here: the Put operation blindly sends a token to the channel, which might be received by a goroutine that has already abandoned its wait, resulting in the token (and the connection capacity) being lost forever (Resource Leak). Alternatively, using sync.Cond.Broadcast wakes everyone up, causing a "Thundering Herd" for a single resource.",
