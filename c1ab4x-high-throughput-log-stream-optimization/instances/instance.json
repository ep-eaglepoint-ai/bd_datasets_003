            "problem_statement": "High-throughput systems often fail not due to algorithmic complexity (Big-O), but due to memory bandwidth and System Call overhead. The legacy code commits two cardinal sins: loading full files into RAM (io.ReadAll), which crashes on large inputs, and performing excessive heap allocations (string conversions and full JSON parsing) inside a tight loop. Mid-tier models will often fix the memory issue by switching to a loop but will fail to optimize the parsing, leaving the CPU bottlenecked by the Garbage Collector. The engineering solution requires a "Streaming" mindset: using bufio to batch I/O operations and manipulating raw []byte slices to avoid creating short-lived string objects.",
