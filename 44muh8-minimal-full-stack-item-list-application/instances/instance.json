The backend must provide a read endpoint and an add endpoint using only in-memory or single-file storage (no database server). The frontend must be a single HTML page with plain CSS and JavaScript, updating the list dynamically without full page reloads. Input validation must enforce item names between 1 and 200 characters, returning HTTP 400 for invalid data. No editing, deleting, or authentication features are required.",
