You need to write a deterministic Vitest test suite for a legacy JavaScript retry queue module.
The module manages asynchronous task execution, retries, cancellation, and exposes internal statistics.

The implementation relies on Promises, timers, and shared module state, and its correctness depends on subtle execution order and state transitions. Some behaviors are non-intuitive and must be verified exactly as they occur at runtime.

Your task is to write tests that capture real behavior, not ideal behavior.
You must not modify the implementation.
The test suite must be stable, repeatable, and prevent regressions caused by incorrect assumptions about async timing or state management.
