            "problem_statement": "Engineer a robust Linux utility to compute the exact rolling median of a signed 64-bit integer stream (int64_t) via stdin. The system must achieve O(log n) update complexity using a Dual-Heap (Min-Max) architecture. A critical "Gold Gap" requirement is the elimination of Undefined Behavior (UB) during middle-element summation; the implementation must handle cases where a + b exceeds 2^{63}-1 without precision loss or overflow. Given the "Exact Correctness" constraint, floating-point arithmetic is prohibited. Medians for even-sized sets must be output as exact rational representations (e.g., x.5 or n/d). The engine must process 10^7+ integers in a single pass, maintaining strict memory efficiency and silently discarding malformed input without interrupting the stream.",
