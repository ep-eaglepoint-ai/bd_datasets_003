            "problem_statement": "The refactored implementation of compute_final_prices preserves output correctness but violates the stated O(n + m) time complexity requirement under adversarial inputs.

Specifically, the discount accumulation logic uses list concatenation to build per-route discount sequences. This introduces repeated list copying, causing quadratic time behavior for routes with many associated discounts and unnecessary memory churn in a latency-sensitive production path.",
