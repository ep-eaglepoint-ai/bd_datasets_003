            "problem_statement": "The engineering challenge lies in the implementation of a rigid Asynchronous Finite State Machine where transition logic is governed by a complex hierarchy of constraints rather than simple sequence. Unlike standard web logic, traffic systems function as "Safety-Critical" software; the model must prioritize the "All-Red" clearance interval (where all lights are red for 2 seconds to clear the intersection) above all else during a handover. Mid-tier models typically fail in two specific areas: "State Teleportation," where they switch immediately from Green to Red upon receiving an emergency signal (causing a virtual crash), and "Starvation/Deadlock," where the logic fails to revert to the normal cycle after the emergency signal is lifted, leaving the intersection frozen in the preemption state.
