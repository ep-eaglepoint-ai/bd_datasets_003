            "problem_statement": "The current aggregator uses a global mutex for every message add, causing severe lock contention under high concurrency (thousands of WebSocket goroutines). Buffers grow unbounded if Flush lags, leading to OOM risk. Mid-tier models often keep the global lock, use channels incorrectly, or forget to bound memory. Correct optimizations must use sharded locks or lock-free patterns, bounded per-room buffers, and efficient flushing.
