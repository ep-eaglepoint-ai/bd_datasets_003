            "problem_statement": "Maintaining consistent code style is essential for readability, maintainability, and collaboration in Python projects, especially as codebases grow and multiple developers contribute. PEP 8 defines the standard style guidelines for Python code, but manual enforcement is error-prone and inconsistent. Writing an automated unit test to check PEP 8 compliance ensures that style violations are detected early, prevents non-conforming code from being merged, and helps teams maintain a uniform coding standard without relying on manual reviews.",
