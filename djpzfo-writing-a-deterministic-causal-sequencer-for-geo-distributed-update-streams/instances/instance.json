            "problem_statement": "Our distributed data pipeline is currently experiencing Replay Divergence. When independent source streams are merged for long-term archival, the resulting sequence varies across different worker nodes due to a lack of a unified causal tracking mechanism. This inconsistency makes it impossible to perform reliable backfills or audit the system state post-facto. We require a Deterministic Sequencer that can ingest partially-ordered streams and produce a byte-for-byte identical output regardless of network jitter. This is a critical business requirement for our Compliance and Disaster Recovery protocols, as any divergence in the archived log results in corrupted state reconstruction during a failover.",
