The existing implementation is correct but inefficient: it rescans stored data, recomputes metrics repeatedly, and retains unnecessary history.

The task is to optimize the implementation while preserving the exact legacy behavior.
Any optimization that changes results, entity lifetime, eviction behavior, or determinism is considered incorrect—even if performance improves.
