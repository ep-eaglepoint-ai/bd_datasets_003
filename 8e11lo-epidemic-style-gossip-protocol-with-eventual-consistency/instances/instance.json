            "problem_statement": "You are a Platform Engineer building a service discovery system for a microservices architecture with 100+ nodes. The current centralized service registry (using a single database) has become a bottleneck and single point of failure, causing 15+ minutes of downtime per month when the registry crashes. During a recent incident, 50 services couldn't discover each other, resulting in a complete platform outage costing $200K in lost revenue.

Your task is to implement a decentralized gossip protocol in `gossip.py` that disseminates cluster membership information across nodes using epidemic-style communication. The protocol must achieve eventual consistency, converge to a consistent state within O(log N) rounds, support arbitrary metadata per node (not just membership), and handle network partitions gracefully.",
