            "problem_statement": "You are a Backend Engineer maintaining a distributed state management service for a financial trading platform. The gRPC service handles account balances and must maintain strict consistency. Under load testing with 100+ concurrent requests, the system shows critical data corruption: duplicate transactions are processed, updates are lost, and account balances become inconsistent across replicas. Sequential tests pass, but concurrent tests fail 15% of the time, causing $50K+ in reconciliation costs per incident.

Your task is to fix all race conditions in `state_service.go` using Go's sync package, ensuring the service maintains data consistency under high concurrency while preventing deadlocks.",
