Initial prototypes show inconsistent behavior: iterators crash during traversal, deletion corrupts tree structure, and the code fails to compile with standard key-value pair semantics. The implementation must handle generic key/value types, maintain O(log n) operations, and provide STL-compatible iterators. Core logic is in avl_tree.h with test coverage in test_avl.cpp.",
