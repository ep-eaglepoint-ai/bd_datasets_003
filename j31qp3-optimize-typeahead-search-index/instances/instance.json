            "problem_statement": "The current typeahead (autocomplete) service uses a naive array filtering approach that scales linearly O(N) with the dataset size. As the dataset has grown to 500,000 weighted terms, latency has spiked to 200ms+, and the service creates excessive garbage during request spikes, triggering OOM kills on our 256MB containers. The goal is to refactor the storage engine to use a specialized data structure that supports sub-millisecond prefix lookups.",
