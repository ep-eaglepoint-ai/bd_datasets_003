            "problem_statement": "Received a feature request from the product team to build an internal productivity tool for the engineering department. Team leads noticed that developers struggle with focus during long coding sessions and want a simple, accessible timer application that follows the Pomodoro Technique. The tool should live as a standalone web app accessible from any browser without installation, and it needs to track completed focus sessions so developers can review their productivity patterns.",
