            "problem_statement": "Build a lightweight waitlist application that allows users to join a queue using their email address and receive a unique referral code. Users can share their referral code with others to earn priority in the waitlist. Each successful referral boosts the referrer’s position upward in the queue while maintaining fair ordering, preventing abuse, and enforcing strict referral rules. The system must handle queue reordering deterministically, prevent circular or self-referrals, and work without a database persisting state in a JSON file instead. The application should expose a small REST API and be implemented using a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.",
