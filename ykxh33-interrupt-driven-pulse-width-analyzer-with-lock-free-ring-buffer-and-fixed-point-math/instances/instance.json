            "problem_statement": "A laboratory measurement system requires sub-microsecond precision for analyzing high-frequency square waves (up to 500kHz) on a resource-constrained MCU. The current polling-based approach introduces unacceptable jitter and misses transitions during processing. An interrupt-driven solution using hardware timers and input capture is needed, with a lock-free ring buffer for non-blocking data transfer to the main loop for real-time FFT/variance analysis. The system must maintain precision during long captures and recover from faults without data loss.",
