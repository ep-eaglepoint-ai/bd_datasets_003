            "problem_statement": "Developers managing dozens of microservices frequently experience startup failures due to local .env files being out of sync with the master config-template.yaml. There is no automated mechanism to detect missing, optional, or secret environment variables, which causes onboarding delays and debugging overhead. The task is to build a Python 3.12 CLI tool (env-sync) that validates and synchronizes .env files against the YAML template, enforcing naming conventions, preventing secret leaks, preserving user values, and supporting an interactive update mode with secure secret prompts.",
