            "problem_statement": "Refactor a legacy Go-based HTTP reverse proxy that utilizes a heavy, lock-based circuit breaker. The existing implementation suffers from extreme mutex contention on a 2-CPU gateway, bottlenecking throughput. You must replace the synchronization primitives with lock-free atomic operations and implement a more robust 3-state machine with a sliding window for failure tracking.",
