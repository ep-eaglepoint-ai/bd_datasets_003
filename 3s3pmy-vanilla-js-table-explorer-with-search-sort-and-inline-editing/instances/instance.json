  "problem_statement": "Build a small, reliable table UI in a single HTML file using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The component must let users browse an in-memory dataset, filter it by search, sort it by column, and edit rows inline with save/cancel support. The UI must manage state predictably so that searching and sorting don't corrupt the underlying data, edits can be safely saved or reverted, and invalid edits show clear feedback without breaking the table. The component must also be usable with both mouse and keyboard.",
