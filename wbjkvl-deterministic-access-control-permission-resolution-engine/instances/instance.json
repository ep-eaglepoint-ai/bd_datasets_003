            "problem_statement": "You are building a core Access Control / Authorization engine used by multiple internal services to decide whether a request should be ALLOWED or DENIED.
 The engine receives untrusted, heterogeneous input for policies, rules, requests, and options. Inputs may be malformed, missing fields, wrong types, or partially valid.
The system must never crash, must apply strict, deterministic conflict-resolution rules, and must always return the same decision and reasons for the same inputs.
 DENY rules must override ALLOW rules, rule priority and specificity must be respected, and invalid data must be handled via defined fallbacks—not exceptions.
This engine is security-critical and must be safe, predictable, auditable, and fully in-memory.
