            "problem_statement": "You are building a deterministic retry scheduler for an internal job-execution system.
The scheduler receives tasks, emits retry attempts when they become due, and records results for each attempt.

The system must behave identically across runs: given the same inputs in the same order, it must emit the same attempts in the same sequence even after its state is snapshotted and restored.

Task results may arrive late, out of order, or be repeated. The scheduler must remain correct and auditable under these conditions. No real time or external systems may be used; all behavior must be driven by explicit inputs.
