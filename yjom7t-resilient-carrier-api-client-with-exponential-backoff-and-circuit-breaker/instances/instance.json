            "problem_statement": "Our Logistics-Link service integrates with external shipping carriers that frequently experience transient failures such as network instability, rate-limiting (429), and intermittent 5xx errors. The current CarrierClient implementation follows a naive “try-once” model, causing fulfillment workflows to fail immediately on transient issues. This behavior leads to unprocessed orders, operational backlogs, and manual recovery efforts that do not scale during peak traffic periods.
The objective is to refactor the existing CarrierClient into a resilient outbound API client that implements Exponential Backoff with Full Jitter and a Circuit Breaker pattern. The solution must gracefully handle transient failures, protect upstream services from overload, and improve overall system stability—without altering the external interface of the client.",
