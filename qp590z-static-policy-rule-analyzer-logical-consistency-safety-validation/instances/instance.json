You are building a static analysis tool that inspects human-written policy rules for logical correctness and consistency before deployment.
The tool must not execute rules, not simulate outcomes, and not mutate input data.
Instead, it analyzes rule definitions to detect structural errors and logical conflicts such as contradictions, redundancy, shadowing, and ambiguity.

The analyzer must be deterministic, defensive against future enum expansion, and return structured findings explaining why each issue exists.
The same input must always produce the same output, and the tool must be safe to use in security- and compliance-sensitive pipelines.
