The system must support a custom set of glob-like wildcards (recursive, single-segment, and selection groups) while enforcing a strict 'poisoning' protocol where specific exclusion patterns override positive matches. The implementation must avoid standard Regex libraries to ensure predictable performance and strict adherence to the defined precedence logic.",
