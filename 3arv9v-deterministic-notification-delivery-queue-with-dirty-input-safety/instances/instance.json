            "problem_statement": "Multiple internal services push notifications into a shared delivery queue. These notifications come from heterogeneous, untrusted sources and may be malformed, partially valid, or entirely invalid (non-dict values, missing fields, bad timestamps, inconsistent urgency values).
The system requires a deterministic ordering module that ranks notifications for delivery using strict business rules, never crashes on dirty input, and produces identical output for the same input.
Previous implementations failed due to subtle determinism violations (timestamp parsing behavior) and incomplete self-verification logic. The goal is to implement a robust, single-file ordering module that safely normalizes inputs, computes derived values efficiently, preserves stability when required, and proves correctness via a reliable self-test.
