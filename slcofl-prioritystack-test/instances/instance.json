Elements can be pushed onto the stack with or without a specified priority, and the mode can be switched dynamically. The goal of this task is to write a Python test file that validates all key behaviors of the PriorityStack, ensuring that it handles both modes correctly, manages errors, and behaves as expected under various conditions.",
