            "problem_statement": "The dashboard currently lacks a unified navigation and action hub, forcing users to rely on scattered menus and shortcuts that reduce productivity and accessibility. The task is to build a high-performance Command Palette component in React that serves as the primary navigation and action interface, triggered via a keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K). The component must handle filtering, grouping, keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and accessibility requirements while remaining performant with hundreds of actions. The implementation must be fully encapsulated, avoid global side-effect leaks, tolerate dynamic action updates, and provide a robust, accessible user experience suitable for production use.",
