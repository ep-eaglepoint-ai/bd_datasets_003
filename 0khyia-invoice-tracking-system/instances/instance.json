The previous manual process led to late payments, duplicate invoices, and missing audit trails. Your goal is to create a Node.js backend API that handles vendor registration, invoice management, payment processing, and reporting, while ensuring that all invoices are approved before payment, and preventing overpayments and duplicates.",
