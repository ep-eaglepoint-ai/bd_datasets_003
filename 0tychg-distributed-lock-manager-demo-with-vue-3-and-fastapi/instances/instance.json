The system must handle lock acquisition, renewal, expiration, and release across multiple simulated clients while remaining observable, testable, and resilient to failures. The goal is to showcase concurrency control, lease-based locking, and real-time visibility using a Vue 3 frontend and a FastAPI backend.",
