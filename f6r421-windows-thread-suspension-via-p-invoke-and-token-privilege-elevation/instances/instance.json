            "problem_statement": "Unlike POSIX environments where process suspension is achieved via a single SIGSTOP signal, the Windows Win32 API does not expose a native process-level suspension primitive. The engineering requirement mandates a thread-level approach: the system must capture a snapshot of all running threads, filter them by the target Process ID, and individually suspend each constituent thread. This operation introduces significant complexity regarding Access Control Lists (ACLs); the utility must manually acquire and enable SeDebugPrivilege within its own process access token to legally obtain THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME rights on threads owned by other users or system services. Failure to perform this token manipulation usually results in "Access Denied" errors even if the logic is algorithmically correct.",
