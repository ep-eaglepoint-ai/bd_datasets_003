            "problem_statement": "Manual and spreadsheet-based task tracking led to duplicated tasks, missed deadlines, and inconsistent task states, especially when multiple users updated tasks simultaneously. A simple, full-stack task management system is required to act as a single source of truth for task data, enforce strict business rules, and ensure accuracy under concurrent updates. The system must support task creation, updates, history tracking, and concurrency-safe operations while remaining minimal, reliable, and fully runnable via Docker.",
