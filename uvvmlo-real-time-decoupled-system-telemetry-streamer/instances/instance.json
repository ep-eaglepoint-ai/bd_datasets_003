    "problem_statement": "Real-time telemetry systems face a critical bottleneck known as "Slow Consumer Syndrome,
    " where a lagging WebSocket client blocks the core metrics collection loop, causing the entire monitoring service to freeze. Mid-tier implementations naively couple the sampling interval with the network transmission, resulting in a system that collapses under minor network latency or high concurrent client counts. The required architectural gap is implementing a strict Producer-Consumer model using Go channels, where the sampling goroutine acts as an independent producer that pushes state to a central distribution hub, completely agnostic to whether the downstream network clients can keep up.",
