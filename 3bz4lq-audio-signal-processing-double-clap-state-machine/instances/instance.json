            "problem_statement": "Detecting a specific sound event in raw audio data is complex due to false positives. A naive implementation simply checks if (sample > threshold). This fails in real-world environments because loud music, shouting, or dropping a book produces high-amplitude spikes. The engineering solution requires Envelope Detection (calculating the energy curve of the sound) combined with a Finite State Machine that enforces timing constraints. The "Double Clap" logic acts as a password: the first clap arms the system, a mandatory "quiet" interval must follow (debouncing), and the second clap must occur within a precise window. If the logic fails to handle the buffer boundaries (e.g., a clap starts in Buffer A and ends in Buffer B), the detection will be unreliable.
