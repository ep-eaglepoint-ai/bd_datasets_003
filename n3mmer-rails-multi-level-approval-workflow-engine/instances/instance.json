            "problem_statement": "An enterprise resource planning system needs configurable approval workflows for purchase orders and expense reports. Currently, documents are either auto-approved or require manual email chains with no tracking. The business requires multi-level approvals based on amount thresholds and department hierarchy, support for parallel approvers (multiple people must approve), automatic escalation when approvers don't respond in time, and delegation for out-of-office scenarios. All approval actions must be auditable for compliance.",
