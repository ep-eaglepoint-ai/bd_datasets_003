            "problem_statement": "Construct a high-efficiency Markdown-to-HTML parser in Go that operates as a pure stream processor. The parser must read from an `io.Reader` and write to an `io.Writer` byte-by-byte, enforcing a strict 'Single Pass' constraint. It cannot buffer full lines or seek backwards. The challenge is to maintain a sophisticated internal state machine that resolves contextual formatting (like bold `**` vs italic `*` vs lists) without knowing what the next character is until it is read.",
