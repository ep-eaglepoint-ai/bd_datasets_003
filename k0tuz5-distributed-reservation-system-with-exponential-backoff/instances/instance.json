            "problem_statement": "This prompt tests the interaction between a resource-constrained server and an aggressive client. The server-side challenge is "Over-selling": without strict Mutex locking around the read-modify-write cycle of the inventory map, concurrent requests will put the inventory into negative numbers. The client-side challenge is the "Thundering Herd": when the server pushes back with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests), a naive client will immediately retry, effectively DDoS-ing the server and preventing recovery. The solution requires a mathematical implementation of Exponential Backoff (wait time increases exponentially) combined with "Jitter" (randomness) to desynchronize the client threads.",
