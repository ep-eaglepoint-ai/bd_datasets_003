            "problem_statement": "implementing an ACID-compliant transaction engine requires rigorous management of shared mutable state. In a graph environment where transactions frequently touch multiple nodes simultaneously (e.g., A transfers to B, B transfers to A), the risk of Circular Wait Deadlocks is imminent if locks are acquired arbitrarily. A naive implementation that locks resources "on demand" will eventually encounter a situation where Transaction 1 holds Node A and waits for Node B, while Transaction 2 holds Node B and waits for Node A. The engineering solution requires a strict Canonical Lock Ordering strategy (Deterministic Locking), forcing threads to acquire locks in a sorted sequence to mathematically eliminate cycles. Additionally, achieving Isolation prohibits "Dirty Reads," necessitating a Write-Buffering architecture where changes remain local to the transaction scope until the final Commit point.",
