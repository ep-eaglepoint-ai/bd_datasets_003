Refactor methods to use f‑strings/str.format() for templates, pre‑compute repeated values, and leverage Python's efficient string operations to eliminate performance bottlenecks in table building, text analysis, and sanitization. The optimized code must handle large reports efficiently while maintaining functional equivalence with the original implementation.",
