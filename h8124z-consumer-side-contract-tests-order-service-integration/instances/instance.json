            "problem_statement": "Recent production incidents occurred due to silent breaking changes in the Order Service API, causing the Billing Service to fail. The goal is to design consumer-side contract tests that validate the minimum required shape of producer responses, ensure backward compatibility (V1 → V2), tolerate optional fields, and detect breaking changes (missing/renamed/invalid type fields) before deployment. Tests must avoid hardcoding full responses and allow extra optional fields.",
