            "problem_statement": "Standard request-response architectures introduce perceptible latency during drag-and-drop interactions, significantly degrading the user experience on high-latency networks. To achieve a responsive, application-like feel, the system must adopt an Optimistic UI pattern where state transitions are reflected immediately in the client view before server confirmation occurs. This architectural shift creates a complex distributed state problem: the frontend must maintain a high-fidelity snapshot of the previous state to execute a precise rollback if the background API call fails. Additionally, the system must handle high-frequency user inputs ("rapid-fire" dragging) through debouncing or throttling to prevent race conditions that lead to permanent data desynchronization between the client and the backend.",
