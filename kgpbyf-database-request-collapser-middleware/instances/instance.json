When high-traffic keys expire in the cache, the system currently allows every concurrent request to pass through to the database, resulting in redundant IO and CPU spikes. You must implement a request-collapsing mechanism that identifies identical in-flight queries and merges them into a single execution, ensuring that all participating callers receive the same result or error without triggering multiple database calls.",
