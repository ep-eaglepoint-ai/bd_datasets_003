            "problem_statement": "The e-commerce platform's image processing service creates a severe bottleneck during product bulk uploads. Processing large batches takes excessively long because images are handled one at a time on a single CPU core. The server crashes with out-of-memory errors when users upload high-resolution images. There is no way to track progress or cancel long-running batch jobs, and users re-upload the same images repeatedly because the system processes duplicates without detection. Failed images abort the entire batch instead of continuing with remaining files.",
