The configuration object has a server object with a port attribute, and a services array containing multiple service objects, each with a name and optionally a replicas attribute. Your task is to write a TypeScript test file testConfigValidator.ts that verifies the behavior of the validateConfig function. The test cases should ensure that the validation rules are correctly enforced for various valid and invalid configurations.",
