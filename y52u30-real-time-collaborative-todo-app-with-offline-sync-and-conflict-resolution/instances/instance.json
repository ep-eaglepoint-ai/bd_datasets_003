            "problem_statement": "The collaborative todo application loses user edits unpredictably during concurrent editing sessions. When two users modify the same item simultaneously, one update silently disappears without notification. The offline queue replays changes in wrong order after reconnection because it relies on timestamps instead of sequence numbers, causing duplicate items or lost edits. Presence indicators show users who disconnected minutes ago because cleanup happens immediately on socket close without delay for brief network interruptions. 

The WebSocket handler in the Next.js App Router API route crashes on startup because request.socket.server doesn't exist in the App Router runtime. Optimistic UI updates persist even when the server rejects changes due to stale vector clocks, leaving the client in an inconsistent state. Core implementation spans store/todoStore.ts, lib/websocket.ts, lib/vector-clock.ts, and the API routes.",
