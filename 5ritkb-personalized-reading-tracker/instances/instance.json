Implement JWT authentication, integrate a mock book API from JSON data, and use Chart.js with Tailwind CSS for visualizing reading statistics and progress over time. The application must support progress updates, personal notes/ratings, and gamified elements like streaks while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface for book enthusiasts.",
