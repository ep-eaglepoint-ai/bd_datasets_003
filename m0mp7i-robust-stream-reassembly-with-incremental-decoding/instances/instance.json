            "problem_statement": "Reading raw byte streams from network sockets implies that data arrives in arbitrary chunk sizes that ignore logical boundaries, potentially bisecting multi-byte UTF-8 characters or JSON records. Mid-tier solutions often fail by decoding chunks individually, leading to critical UnicodeDecodeError crashes or corrupted data when a newline is split. The solution requires a stateful buffering mechanism that persists residuals across iterations and utilizes an incremental decoding strategy to ensure data integrity without loading the entire stream into memory.",
