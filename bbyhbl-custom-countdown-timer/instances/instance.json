Allow users to create and customize countdowns with Unsplash background images, generate shareable links via nanoid, and optionally save countdowns across devices with Passport.js authentication. The application must display precise time‑remaining breakdowns, support public sharing without accounts, and provide a visually engaging experience for tracking personal milestones.",
