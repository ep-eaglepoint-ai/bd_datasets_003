The current implementation renders all rows in the DOM simultaneously, causing slow initial load times, janky scrolling, and browser crashes on mobile devices. 

Users report that sorting and filtering operations freeze the UI, and the search input re-renders the entire grid on every keystroke. Memory usage grows unbounded during extended scrolling sessions. Core components are in DataGrid.tsx, GridRow.tsx, GridHeader.tsx, and FilterBar.tsx.",
