            "problem_statement": "A production inventory reservation engine processes sequences of inventory actions and returns a final state along with an audit trail describing which actions were accepted or rejected.
Recent issues indicate that the engine may behave incorrectly under adversarial but valid inputs such as duplicates, conflicting actions, invalid quantities, and replays.

Your task is to design a black-box test harness that validates the engine’s correctness by generating stressful input scenarios and asserting critical invariants — without modifying or re-implementing the engine itself.
