            "problem_statement": "The blog platform API built with Laravel is triggering hundreds of database queries on the posts listing endpoint, with each post causing separate lazy-load queries for author, category, tags, and comments through the resource layer. The read_time model accessor loads all comments per post just to count words, the comments_count cached column is stale and never updated, and the comments endpoint returns unbounded result sets causing memory exhaustion on popular posts. Filters for tag, category, and search each re-query from scratch instead of chaining on one query builder, the ?include= parameter is completely ignored, and category tree retrieval recurses one query per child node. Core logic is in PostController.php, CommentController.php, CategoryController.php, the Eloquent models, and the API resource classes.",
