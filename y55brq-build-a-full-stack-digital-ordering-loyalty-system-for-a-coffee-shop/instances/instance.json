            "problem_statement": "A small but growing coffee shop currently takes orders manually, which causes long queues during peak hours, order mistakes, and no reliable way to track repeat customers or reward loyalty.

The business needs a production-ready, full-stack web application that enables customers to place digital orders and allows staff to manage those orders efficiently during busy periods. The system must also support a customer loyalty program that is correct, auditable, and safe under concurrent usage.

The solution must be reliable under peak load (≈40 concurrent users), prevent duplicate or inconsistent orders, and maintain correct product availability and loyalty balances even when requests occur at nearly the same time or when network interruptions happen.",
