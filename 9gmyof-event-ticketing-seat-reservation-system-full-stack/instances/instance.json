The previous system relied on manual coordination and spreadsheets, which caused:
Seats being sold more than once
Users seeing available seats that were already taken
Conflicting updates during high-traffic ticket releases
Inconsistent reservation and payment records
The company now needs a reliable, concurrent-safe web application to manage events, seats, and reservations.",
