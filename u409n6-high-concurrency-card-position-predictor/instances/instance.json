            "problem_statement": "Most card position predictors are written following the lazy approach of materializing card decks passed to their functions. The objective is to write a high-concurrency mathematical model capable of predicting a target card's final index following multiple column-shuffle iterations without materializing the deck in memory. By utilizing a pure recurrence relation, the system must achieve extreme resource efficiency to support massive deck sizes and high-throughput gaming environments.",
