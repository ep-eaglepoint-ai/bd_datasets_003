            "problem_statement": "You are a Systems Engineer building a high-performance logging library for a latency-sensitive trading system processing 50,000 trades/second. The current queue implementation uses mutexes, causing priority inversion: high-priority trading threads are blocked waiting for low-priority logging threads to release locks. This causes latency spikes exceeding 100 microseconds, resulting in missed trading opportunities worth $10K+ per incident and regulatory violations.",
