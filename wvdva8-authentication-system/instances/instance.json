            "problem_statement": "Previous authentication implementations were fragmented across frontend, backend, and database layers, resulting in inconsistent authorization logic, insecure token handling, and unauthorized access to protected resources. A unified, full-stack authentication system is required to serve as a single source of truth for user identity, session management, and role-based access control. The system must provide secure sign-up and sign-in flows, enforce authorization rules consistently, and remain reliable under concurrent usage while being fully runnable through a simple Docker-based setup.",
