The objective of this project is to build a Node.js–based Financial Transaction Processor that manages bank accounts and supports deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while enforcing strict validation rules. The system must accurately track balances, prevent invalid transactions, and maintain a complete transaction history to ensure correctness, reliability, and auditability.",
