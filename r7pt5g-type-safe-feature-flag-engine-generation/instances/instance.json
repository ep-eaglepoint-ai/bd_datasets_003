            "problem_statement": "Design and implement a type-safe feature flag engine in TypeScript where correctness is enforced primarily at compile time. Flags must be declared once with string-literal keys and optional typed payloads. Accessing an undefined flag, using the wrong payload shape/type, or making unsafe assumptions must fail to compile. The design must prevent common TS pitfalls such as key widening to string, returning any/unknown payloads, and non-exhaustive handling when new flags are added. Output a single .ts file showing the engine plus valid/invalid usage (invalid marked to fail at compile time).",
