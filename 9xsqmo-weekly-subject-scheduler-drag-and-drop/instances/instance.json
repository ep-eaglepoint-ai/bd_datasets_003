            "problem_statement": "Creating weekly schedules using static forms or manual inputs can be tedious and unintuitive, especially when users need to rearrange subjects frequently. The objective of this project is to build a React-based Weekly Subject Scheduler that allows users to visually construct a weekly program using drag-and-drop interactions. By representing subjects and time slots graphically, the application enables users to easily assign, move, and organize subjects within a structured timetable while enforcing scheduling constraints such as fixed lunch breaks.",
