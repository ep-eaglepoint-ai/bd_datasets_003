            "problem_statement": "The objective is to engineer a high-precision, standalone JavaScript utility to convert standard Gregorian Date objects into the Ethiopian (Ge'ez) Calendar format (MM/DD/YYYY). Designed for a high-security fintech environment, the implementation must be built from first principles without the aid of external libraries.

The core challenge lies in handling the distinct structural differences of the Ethiopian calendar—which consists of 12 months of 30 days plus a 13th month (Pagumē) of 5 or 6 days—while maintaining mathematical accuracy through Julian Day Number (JDN) transformations. The solution must demonstrate senior-level architectural maturity by refactoring complex conversion logic into discrete, private helper functions and utilizing strict integer math to ensure deterministic results across leap year cycles.",
