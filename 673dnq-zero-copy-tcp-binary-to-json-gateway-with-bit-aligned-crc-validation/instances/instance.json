The current implementation uses WebSocket instead of raw TCP, has incorrect CRC validation, and copies data instead of using zero-copy offsets. Required: raw TCP stream handling with proper bit-aligned CRC-16-CCITT, true zero-copy architecture using buffer offsets, and correct lock-free ring buffer.",
