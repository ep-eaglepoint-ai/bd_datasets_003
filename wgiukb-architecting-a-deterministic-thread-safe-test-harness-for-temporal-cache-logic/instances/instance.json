            "problem_statement": "Our current internal caching libraries are suffering from non-deterministic "flaky" failures in the CI/CD pipeline, primarily due to an over-reliance on system wall-clocks and global monkey-patching during testing. From a business continuity standpoint, this is unacceptable; we require a validation harness that guarantees 100% determinism regardless of CPU load or execution environment. The challenge is to architect a test suite that handles the complex intersection of LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction and TTL (Time-to-Live) expiration without resorting to time.sleep() or fragile global mocks that leak state across test suites.",
