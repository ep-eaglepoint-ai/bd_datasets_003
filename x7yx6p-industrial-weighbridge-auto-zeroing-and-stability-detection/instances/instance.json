This fails in the real world because the "InitialRaw" (Zero) changes throughout the day as rain falls or debris accumulates on the scale. The engineering solution requires Auto-Zero Tracking: a background process that slowly nudges the zero-point when the scale is "Empty and Stable." Crucially, determining "Stable" requires calculating the statistical variance of the signal stream",
