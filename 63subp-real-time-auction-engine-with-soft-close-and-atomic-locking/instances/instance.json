            "problem_statement": "The core challenge lies in managing Mutable Time and State Contention. The "Soft Close" requirement creates a dynamic end-time, causing naive server timers to trigger prematurely during extensions. Simultaneously, "Double-Bid Races" occur when concurrent users submit identical bids; without explicit database transactions or mutexes, the auction state becomes corrupted. Furthermore, the system must mitigate Clock Skew by propagating absolute timestamps, ensuring network latency does not desynchronize the client-side countdowns.",
