            "problem_statement": "You are a Database Engineer at a financial services company running a distributed database across 50 nodes. The current advisory locking system uses a centralized coordinator, creating a bottleneck that limits transaction throughput to 500 TPS. During peak trading hours (9:30-10:00 AM), lock contention causes 2-second delays, resulting in failed trades worth $100K+ per incident.

The system needs a distributed lock manager that scales to 5,000 TPS (10x improvement) while maintaining strict mutual exclusion guarantees. The lock manager must use quorum-based acquisition (majority of nodes must grant lock), detect deadlocks within 2 seconds, and prevent starvation with FIFO ordering. It must survive node failures (up to N/2 - 1 nodes can fail) and support both SHARED and EXCLUSIVE lock modes.

Your task is to implement `distributed_lock.py",
