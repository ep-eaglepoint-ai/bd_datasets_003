            "problem_statement": "Noticed a critical performance challenge when testing a medical claims processing system handling EDI 837 files from zip archives. The issue appeared while working on the batch claims parser in a Go-based healthcare application where processing times degrade from 30 seconds for 100 claims to 8 minutes for 1000 claims, with memory growing from 500MB to 4.2GB.
Testing reveals CPU locked at 100% on a single core while 7 cores sit idle. Competitor systems process identical 1000-claim batches in 45 seconds while the current system takes 6-7 minutes. Production testing shows 5000 claims consume 12GB memory and require 35 minutes, far exceeding the 5-minute regulatory SLA. The billing team faces a backlog of 15,000+ claims missing deadlines.",
