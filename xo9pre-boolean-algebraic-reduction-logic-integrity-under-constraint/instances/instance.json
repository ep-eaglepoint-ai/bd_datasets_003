The objective was to evaluate the model’s ability to perform Pure Logic Optimization on a "spaghetti-code" authentication function. The source code contained 16 possible states across 4 variables (manual_lock, auth_valid, emergency_pulse, fail_safe), including a "Red Herring" variable (manual_lock) that acted as a conditional gatekeeper.

The core challenge was to simplify nested if/else branching into a single, atomic Boolean expression. This tests the model's capacity for Discrete Mathematics over simple pattern matching. To simulate a high-pressure development environment, we introduced a "Sassy" constraint: the final expression had to use 4 or fewer logical operators while maintaining 100% truth-table parity. This forced the model to choose between mathematical honesty and satisfying aggressive optimization targets.
