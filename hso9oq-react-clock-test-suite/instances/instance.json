            "problem_statement": "The development team has built a React class-based clock component that displays the current time and updates every second. The component allows users to switch between English (en-US) and Bengali (bn-BD) locales, changing the time format accordingly. It uses setInterval to update time and clearInterval to handle cleanup during unmounting. A comprehensive Jest and React Testing Library test suite is required to validate timer behavior, locale switching, rendering optimization, and proper lifecycle management.",
