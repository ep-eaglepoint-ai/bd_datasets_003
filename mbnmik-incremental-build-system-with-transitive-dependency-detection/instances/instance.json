            "problem_statement": "You are a Build Systems Engineer at a 200-person software company. The current monolithic build system rebuilds all 50+ components on every code change, taking 30-35 minutes even for single-line changes. This is blocking developer productivity, with engineers spending 4+ hours per day waiting for builds. The previous system uses a naive rebuild-everything approach, wasting 80% of build time on unchanged components.

Your task is to implement an incremental build system in `build_system.py` that only rebuilds changed components and their dependents, while correctly handling transitive dependencies and detecting circular dependency errors.",
