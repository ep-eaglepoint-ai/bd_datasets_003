The previous system led to lost tickets, delayed responses, and poor reporting. Your goal is to create a Node.js backend API that allows customers to submit tickets, agents to manage them, and the company to track SLA compliance, agent performance, and ticket status—all while preventing lost or unresolved tickets.",
