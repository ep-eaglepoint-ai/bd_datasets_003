            "problem_statement": "The data pipeline team reports that the JSON parser crashes when processing deeply nested configuration files from partner integrations. Stack traces show segmentation faults at 500+ nesting levels, and memory profiling reveals the parser allocates 3-4x the input size due to excessive string copying. Processing a 50KB API response takes 47ms instead of the expected <5ms, and large array parsing exhibits O(n²) behavior causing exponential slowdown. The parser also corrupts Unicode characters in international product names, outputting garbled text for \uXXXX escape sequences. Core logic is in json_parser.cpp and lexer.cpp.",
