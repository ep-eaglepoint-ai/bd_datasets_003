Records are expected to arrive at a fixed interval (in minutes). Given records, interval_minutes, window_start, and window_end (half-open), return a list of missing time gaps and a human-readable explanation. The output must be deterministic, validate inputs, and precisely align gaps to the expected timestamp grid so the gaps represent missing expected samples, not just “time between records.”",
