            "problem_statement": "Cryptographic multi-sig implementations in Python are error-prone: models often introduce timing leaks via non-constant comparisons, use weak random sources, mishandle nonce management, produce malleable signatures, skip strict input checks, or expose secrets in exceptions/logs. The correct solution demands secure randomness, careful constant-time patterns (where feasible), proper aggregation math, replay defenses, and robust validation — all while maintaining clean, exception-safe code.",
