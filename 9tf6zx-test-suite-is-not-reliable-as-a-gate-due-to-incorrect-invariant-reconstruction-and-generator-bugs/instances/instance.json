            "problem_statement": "The submitted JavaScript test suite demonstrates a good understanding of the system’s invariants and attempts to apply adversarial, property-based testing. However, it cannot be relied upon as a gate test suite as required by the prompt.

The primary issue is that the test logic itself contains correctness flaws and ambiguous assumptions about the output format. These flaws make it possible for the test suite to:

Fail correct implementations under valid adversarial inputs, or

Pass buggy implementations that should be rejected.

Because the tests are intended to serve as a blocking gate against regressions and hidden mutants, correctness and interpretability of test results are mandatory. This bar is not met.",
