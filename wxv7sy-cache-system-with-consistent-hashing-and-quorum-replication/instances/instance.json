            "problem_statement": "You are a Systems Engineer at a high-traffic e-commerce platform serving 10 million requests per minute (166,667 req/sec). The current centralized cache becomes a bottleneck at peak load, causing 500ms+ latency spikes and frequent cache misses when nodes fail. The system needs a distributed cache that maintains < 50ms p99 latency even during node failures while ensuring data consistency across replicas.

The cache must distribute keys evenly across a 10-node cluster using consistent hashing with 150 virtual nodes per physical node. Each key must be replicated to 3 nodes with quorum-based reads (R=2) and writes (W=2) to guarantee strong consistency. When nodes are added, only affected keys (~1/N) should migrate, not all keys. Node failures must be detected within 5 seconds via heartbeat monitoring, with automatic replica promotion within 10 seconds.

Your task is to implement `distributed_cache.py` that provides GET/SET/DELETE operations ",
