            "problem_statement": "we want to implement RFID but Raw RFID data is notoriously noisy. "Cross-reads" occur when Antenna A picks up a tag physically located near Antenna B due to signal reflections. A naive logic that simply trusts the "last antenna seen" will flicker rapidly between locations, generating thousands of false movement events. The engineering solution requires RSSI Smoothing (averaging signal strength over a time window) to determine the "True Zone" based on signal dominance, combined with a Hysteresis Loop to prevent state flickering during the transition period between zones.",
