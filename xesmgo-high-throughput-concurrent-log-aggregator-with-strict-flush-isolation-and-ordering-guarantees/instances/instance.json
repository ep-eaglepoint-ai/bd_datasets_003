            "problem_statement": "You are building a high-throughput log aggregation service in Go that ingests log entries concurrently from many sources, aggregates them by severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR), and periodically flushes them to a storage function.
The system must operate under sustained high load with strict latency, scalability, and correctness guarantees. Functional correctness alone is insufficient — the implementation must ensure flush isolation, avoid global lock contention, preserve per-source ordering across flushes, and scale independently per severity bucket.
The design must remain safe under high contention and long-running execution, with predictable performance characteristics and no hidden blocking paths during ingestion or flushing.
