            "problem_statement": "Organizations currently rely on email or chat tools to handle internal service requests, leading to lost messages, unclear ownership, and lack of accountability. As request volume increases, it becomes difficult to track status changes, follow up on unresolved issues, or understand workload distribution. These problems are amplified in multi-organization environments where data separation and access control are critical. A centralized system is needed to improve visibility, structure, and reliability of request handling.
