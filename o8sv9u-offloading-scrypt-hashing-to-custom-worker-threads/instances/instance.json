            "problem_statement": "Cryptographic hashing functions like Scrypt are designed to be slow and memory-hard to resist brute-force attacks. In Node.js, running these synchronously (scryptSync) is catastrophic for throughput. While Node.js offers asynchronous variants (scrypt), these rely on the internal libuv thread pool (default size 4). If a high volume of hash requests comes in, they saturate the libuv pool, blocking other OS-level operations like File I/O and DNS lookups.",
