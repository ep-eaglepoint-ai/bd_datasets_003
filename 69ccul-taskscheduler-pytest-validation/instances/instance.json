            "problem_statement": "We evaluated multiple pytest-based test suites intended to validate a concurrent TaskScheduler with dependency constraints. While the suites correctly validate basic dependency ordering, deadlock prevention, and concurrent submission, they fail to fully enforce several critical correctness guarantees required under real-world conditions. In particular, sustained high-load behavior, strict stop() flush semantics, and reliable race-condition exposure are not conclusively validated. These gaps allow incorrect scheduler implementations to pass despite violating core lifecycle and concurrency guarantees. A revised test specification is required to ensure failures are detected deterministically and under realistic stress conditions.",
