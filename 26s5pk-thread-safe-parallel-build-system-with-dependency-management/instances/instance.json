            "problem_statement": "You are a DevOps Engineer at a software company with a large monorepo containing 80 components. The build system was recently parallelized to speed up CI/CD from 15 minutes (sequential) to 3 minutes (parallel with 8 workers). However, the parallel implementation has critical race conditions causing a 10% failure rate: builds fail randomly, artifacts are corrupted from concurrent writes, and the build cache becomes unreliable. Sequential builds work perfectly, but parallel builds are broken. Developers now waste 30+ minutes re-running failed builds multiple times per day.

Your task is to fix all race conditions in `parallel_build.py` using Python's threading or multiprocessing, ensuring builds are deterministic and artifact integrity is maintained under parallel execution.",
