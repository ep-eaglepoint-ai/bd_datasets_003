            "problem_statement": "Refactoring a legacy Node.js application that uses tightly coupled function calls for component communication. The payment processing module directly calls notification functions, logging functions, and analytics functions, making the code difficult to test and extend. The architecture team wants to decouple these components using an event-driven pattern where the payment module simply emits events and other modules subscribe independently. The system needs a lightweight event emitter that supports multiple subscribers per event, passes data payloads to handlers, and can remove specific listeners when components unmount. The team evaluated the built-in EventEmitter but wants a custom implementation for learning purposes and to add features like once listeners that auto-remove after firing and typed event definitions for better development experience with TypeScript.",
