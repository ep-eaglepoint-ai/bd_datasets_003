            "problem_statement": "Our current C++ scheduling architecture is vulnerable to State Divergence during hardware failures. The reliance on mmap for persistence fails to provide atomic "All-or-Nothing" guarantees, leading to scenarios where a transaction is partially written during a crash. Furthermore, the worker handover lacks Linearizability; network partitions can cause duplicate execution of financial updates. We need to refactor the core engine to use a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability and a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) handshake to ensure that a task is only marked "Complete" if the side effect and the state update are atomically verified.",
