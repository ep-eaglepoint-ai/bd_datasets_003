            "problem_statement": "Stateless packet inspectors are easily bypassed by splitting malicious payloads across multiple TCP segments. The "Reassembly Trap" requires the engineer to track the Sequence Number of every packet. If Packet A has Seq=100, Len=10 (ends at 110), and Packet C arrives with Seq=120, the system must buffer Packet C and wait for Packet B (Seq=110, Len=10). Naive models often just concatenate payloads as they arrive, which fails when packets arrive out of order (a common occurrence on the internet)",
