            "problem_statement": "Our current batch-delivery infrastructure lacks the architectural safeguards required for mission-critical reliability. In production, we are seeing two significant business risks: first, **Retry Storms**, where immediate re-attempts on transient failures overwhelm downstream services, leading to total system outages; and second, **State Inconsistency**, where duplicate entries in a batch or non-idempotent send operations cause data corruption. We require a sophisticated validation suite that proves the system can handle duplicate inputs without state-leakage and confirms that the retry logic is "environment-aware"—incorporating backoff strategies that protect our infrastructure during periods of high volatility.",
