            "problem_statement": "You are a Software Engineer at a medical clinic with 10 doctors across 4 specialties serving 500+ patients/week. Current phone-based scheduling causes 15% double-bookings from manual errors, 10+ minute hold times during peak hours (9-11 AM), and 25% no-show rate costing $50K/year. Build an online booking system preventing double-bookings, sending automated reminders, and managing waitlists. Support 10 doctors with 8 AM-6 PM hours (Monday-Friday), appointment types (15/30/60-minute), 24-hour cancellation policy with $50 late fees. Implement full-stack application with Python Flask, PostgreSQL, React, Redis, Docker handling 100+ concurrent bookings without conflicts, sending reminders at exact times (24h and 2h before), completing booking flow in < 3 seconds.
