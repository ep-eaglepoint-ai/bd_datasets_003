            "problem_statement": "Automating web server configuration is high-risk. A naive automation script simply copies a new config file to /etc/httpd/conf.d/ and runs restart. If the new config contains a syntax error, the web server crashes and stays down. The engineering "Trap" here is the order of operations and atomicity. The model must implement a "Test-Then-Apply" logic. Furthermore, simply restarting the service drops active connections. The correct approach is a "Graceful Reload" via OS Signals (SIGHUP), which requires finding the target Process ID (PID) by reading and parsing the PID file manually, as external service managers are forbidden",
