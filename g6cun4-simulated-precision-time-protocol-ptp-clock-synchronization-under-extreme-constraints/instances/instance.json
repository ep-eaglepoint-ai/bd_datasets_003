Core Constraints:

No Real-Time APIs: You must use a manual loop; time and sleep are forbidden.

PTP Logic: Every 1,000ns (Clock A), B and C must receive a timestamp and calculate a frequency adjustment to converge over 500 iterations. Direct counter overwrites are prohibited.

Encoding: Final reports must use bitwise XOR for ASCII conversion. String concatenation via + and str() casting are forbidden.",
