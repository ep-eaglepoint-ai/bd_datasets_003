The module receives a translation map (which may be incomplete), a list of user-preferred locales in priority order, and a default locale. It must choose the first available translation using a clear fallback strategy: try preferred locales first, then the default locale. If no translation can be found, it must fail safely without throwing and return a structured result explaining which locales were attempted and why resolution failed. The module must be deterministic, strongly typed, and safe to use in both frontend and backend systems.",
