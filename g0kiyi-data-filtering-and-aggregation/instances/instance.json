            "problem_statement": "Optimize a Python data filtering and aggregation system by replacing O(n²) operations—like repeated full‑list scans and bubble sort—with O(1) hash‑based indexes, set lookups, generators, and built‑in functions (sum(), sorted()) to efficiently process 100,000+ records. Refactor methods to avoid intermediate lists, pre‑compute indexes where possible, and compute aggregates in a single pass while maintaining identical results to the original implementation. Ensure all filtering, grouping, and join operations leverage lazy evaluation and proper data structures for scalable performance.",
