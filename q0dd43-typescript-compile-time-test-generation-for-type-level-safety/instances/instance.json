            "problem_statement": "You are given a TypeScript library whose correctness depends heavily on compile-time guarantees such as branded types, discriminated unions, conditional types, and exhaustiveness checks. Past test suites validated runtime behavior but failed to enforce these compile-time contracts, allowing unsafe code to compile silently.

The task is to generate a complete test suite that proves both runtime behavior and compile-time type safety. The tests must ensure that invalid usage fails at compile time, that exhaustiveness is enforced when unions evolve, and that common TypeScript pitfalls (unanchored type assertions, incorrect @ts-expect-error usage, meaningless generic checks, and shallow union tests) are explicitly caught. The output must be deterministic, in-repo friendly, and runnable using standard TypeScript and test-runner tooling.",
