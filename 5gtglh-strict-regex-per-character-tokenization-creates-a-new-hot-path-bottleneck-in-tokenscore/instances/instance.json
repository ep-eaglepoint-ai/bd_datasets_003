            "problem_statement": "The optimized implementation of the ranking function introduces a new performance bottleneck in the hottest execution path, undermining the primary goal of the optimization task.

While the refactor aims to remove expensive per-candidate allocations and redundant computations, it relies on a high-cost operation inside the innermost loop, which is executed for every character of every candidate title. At production scale (hundreds of thousands of candidates per request), this creates a dominant CPU cost that can negate or exceed the original overheads the refactor was intended to eliminate.

As a result, the solution does not reliably meet the stated latency and performance objectives under worst-case or adversarial input distributions.",
