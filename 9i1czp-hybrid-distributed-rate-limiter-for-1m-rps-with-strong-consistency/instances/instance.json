            "problem_statement": "Create a production-ready distributed rate limiting system for cloud-native microservices that enforces global request quotas (e.g., 1000 requests/second) across all service instances. The system must maintain p99 latency <10ms under sustained loads of ≥1M requests/second while surviving individual node failures without significant accuracy degradation. The solution must avoid single-point bottlenecks, reject eventual consistency models for quota enforcement, use only typical cloud provider services (Redis permitted), and scale memory usage sub-linearly with request volume.",
