            "problem_statement": "Implement a pure data-processing function that takes an array of objects, removes invalid entries, and conditionally normalizes valid ones. Objects marked with active: false must be excluded from the result. For remaining objects, the name field must be trimmed if it is a string. The function must guarantee zero mutation of the input data and preserve reference identity wherever no transformation is required. New objects may only be created when a transformation actually occurs, and unchanged objects must remain referentially equal to their input counterparts. The result must strictly reflect these rules without introducing additional behavior, assumptions, or side effects.",
