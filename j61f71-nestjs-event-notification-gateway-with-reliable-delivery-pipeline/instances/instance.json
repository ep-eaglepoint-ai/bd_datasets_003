            "problem_statement": "A multi-tenant SaaS platform allows customers to subscribe to application events via HTTP callbacks. The current notification system has no retry mechanism, no protection against unresponsive endpoints, and customers have no visibility into delivery status. When a customer's server is temporarily down, all notifications are lost. The platform needs a reliable notification pipeline that guarantees delivery, handles failures gracefully, and provides operational visibility.",
