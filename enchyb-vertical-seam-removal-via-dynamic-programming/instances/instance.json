            "problem_statement": "The core algorithmic challenge of Seam Carving is the implementation of global optimization via Dynamic Programming rather than a naive greedy heuristic. Mid-tier solutions frequently fail by simply selecting the lowest-energy neighbor at each step, which ignores the cumulative cost of the path and results in suboptimal seams that cut through important visual content. From a systems perspective, the manipulation of Go's image.RGBA structure presents a significant memory management trap; excising a vertical seam requires precise slice shifting within the raw Pix buffer to preserve alignment (Stride) without allocating entirely new image buffers, while simultaneously handling boundary conditions to avoid index-out-of-bounds panics during gradient calculation.",
