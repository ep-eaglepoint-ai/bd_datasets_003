            "problem_statement": "Standard Docker tutorials teach ARG for passing data, but ARG values are burned into the image metadata, which is a major security flaw for private keys. The engineering gap here is leveraging BuildKit syntax.
The Security Trap: Mid-tier models will use ARG SSH_KEY and then echo $SSH_KEY > /root/.ssh/id_rsa. This works functionally but fails the security requirement because the key persists in the intermediate layer.
The Cache Trap: To speed up builds, they might use COPY go.mod . and RUN go mod download. While standard, this doesn't cache the downloaded modules between builds if the layer cache is invalidated. The SOTA approach is RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod.
The Arch Trap: For cross-compilation (e.g., building ARM64 on an AMD64 machine), the GOARCH variable must be set dynamically based on the build target, usually via the automatic TARGETARCH argument provided by BuildKit.
