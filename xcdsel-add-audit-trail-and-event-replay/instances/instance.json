When debugging disputes or investigating “what happened when,” the team cannot see a complete, ordered history of changes per order or reconstruct past state. The business needs a durable, append-only record of state-changing events per order, a way to retrieve that history, and the ability to replay events to reconstruct order state at a point in time—without changing existing order API behavior or introducing new infrastructure.",
