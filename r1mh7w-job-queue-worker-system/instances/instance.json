            "problem_statement": "In microservices platforms, synchronous job execution can lead to timeouts, blocked requests, and lost background work. The objective of this project is to design and implement a Go-based background job processing system that queues jobs, distributes them to worker pools, handles retries with exponential backoff, and moves unrecoverable jobs to a dead letter queue. This system must ensure asynchronous job execution, reliable failure handling, and avoid job loss, acting as a backbone for processing background workloads across various services.",
