            "problem_statement": "Modern web applications often depend on external services that can become slow or unavailable, leading to cascading failures and poor user experience. This task focuses on designing and implementing a Circuit Breaker demo system in Nuxt 3 that protects server routes from repeated failures, provides fast fallback responses, and clearly visualizes breaker behavior. The goal is to demonstrate how resilience patterns can be applied in a Nuxt 3 application to maintain stability and graceful degradation when interacting with unreliable services.",
