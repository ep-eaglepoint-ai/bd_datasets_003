            "problem_statement": "You are optimizing a production SQL query used for daily data-integrity validation between orders and users.
 The query identifies invalid records such as missing users, soft-deleted users, and NULL foreign keys. Its output is consumed by finance and compliance teams and is reviewed by humans.
The current implementation is functionally correct but inefficient at scale.
 Your task is to optimize the query without changing its observable behavior.
Any optimization must preserve:
the exact result set
the exact validation categories

row-level diagnostic clarity
correct handling of NULLs and soft deletes
Performance improvements are required, but correctness and auditability are non-negotiable.",
