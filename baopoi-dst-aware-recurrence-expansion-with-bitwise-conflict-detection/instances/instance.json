            "problem_statement": "Recurring scheduling logic is complicated by the disconnect between absolute time (UTC) and civil time (Wall Clock). A rule defined as "Every day at 9:00 AM New York" implies a variable UTC offset throughout the year due to Daylight Saving Time. Implementing this using simple fixed-interval arithmetic (e.g., adding 86400 seconds) results in scheduling errors where meetings shift by an hour post-transition. The solution requires calculating each instance's naive local time independently before converting to UTC. Additionally, to achieve high-performance conflict detection across thousands of slots, the temporal data must be mapped to a bit array or integer mask, allowing availability checks to be performed via single-cycle bitwise AND operations rather than iterative range comparisons.",
