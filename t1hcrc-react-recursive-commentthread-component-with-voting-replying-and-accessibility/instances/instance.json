            "problem_statement": "The existing flat comment system prevents nuanced conversations and direct replies. The goal is to build a recursive CommentThread React component in TypeScript that renders hierarchical comments with voting and replying features. It must efficiently handle deeply nested threads (capped at 6 levels), prevent unnecessary re-renders, maintain immutability, and provide full accessibility support including ARIA roles and keyboard navigation. The component should also support collapse/expand toggles, format timestamps in “time ago” style, and gracefully handle empty states.",
