Implement MongoDB/Mongoose for data persistence, NextAuth.js for authentication, and provide organization via collections/tags, format exports (CSS, Tailwind, JSON, PNG via html2canvas), and a community gallery. The tool must support robust palette management, public sharing, and efficient search while delivering a smooth, professional design workflow.",
