            "problem_statement": "Detecting patterns in streams requires maintaining state. The "Trap" is assuming a user has only one active state at a time. In reality, a user might trigger the start of the pattern multiple times before completing it. If the model uses a single variable currentState = "WAITING_FOR_RESET", a second LOGIN_FAILED event might overwrite the timestamp of the first one, or be ignored, potentially missing a valid fraud signal or allowing a timeout to be bypassed. The solution requires a list of active state pointers per user (e.g., map[UserID][]*PartialMatch). Additionally, "Zombie States" (partial matches that timed out hours ago) must be removed to avoid O(N) memory growth.
