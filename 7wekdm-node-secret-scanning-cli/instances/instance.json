            "problem_statement": "The task is to build a high-performance Secret-Scanning CLI utility designed to be used as a pre-commit security hook. The service must scan local files and memory buffers for exposed API keys, private credentials, and high-entropy strings that likely represent secrets. The system must utilize a combination of signature-based detection (Regex) and Shannon Entropy calculation to identify both known token formats (e.g., AWS, Stripe) and unknown random-looking strings. It must support high-speed scanning of large directories while respecting ignore-lists and providing a structured JSON audit report of all detected risks.",
