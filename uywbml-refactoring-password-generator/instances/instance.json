            "problem_statement": "The company’s Tkinter-based password generator has become unstable after recent code changes introduced unsafe threading and shared-state “optimizations.” Users experience delayed, missing, or out-of-order password displays, UI freezes, clipboard failures, and random crashes. Memory and CPU usage grow continuously due to unmanaged background threads and infinite loops. UI updates are performed from non-main threads, causing race conditions and unpredictable behavior. The application must be urgently refactored to restore reliability, performance, and correctness while preserving all existing features and UI layout.",
