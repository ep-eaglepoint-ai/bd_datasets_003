            "problem_statement": "The project requires a high-performance Cache-Aside Manager that orchestrates data flow between a primary mock database and an in-memory Least Recently Used (LRU) store. The goal is to minimize database load by caching frequent queries while strictly adhering to a memory-bound capacity. The service must implement a deterministic eviction policy, handle Time-to-Live (TTL) expirations, and provide atomic synchronization logic to prevent stale data from persisting in the cache after database updates.
