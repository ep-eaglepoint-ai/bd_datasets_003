            "problem_statement": "he fundamental pattern of Agentic AI is the execution loop. While frameworks abstract this away, the core engineering challenge is robust Feedback Propagation. A naive implementation runs func(*args); if this crashes (e.g., ValueError), the entire program exits. The correct solution treats exceptions as data. The runtime must wrap every tool execution in a try...except block, convert the traceback or error message into a string, and append it to the conversation history. This allows the LLM to "see" its mistake and retry (e.g., "Oh, I used the wrong argument type, let me fix that").
