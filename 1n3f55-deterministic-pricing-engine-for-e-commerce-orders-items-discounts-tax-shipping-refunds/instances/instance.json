            "problem_statement": "An e-commerce platform needs a deterministic pricing engine after finance detected small but recurring discrepancies caused by rounding, tax handling, and operation ordering.
 The engine must calculate order totals accurately while processing item prices, per-item discounts, order-level discounts, taxes (exclusive and inclusive), shipping, and refunds.
 All monetary calculations must avoid binary floating-point arithmetic and use exact decimal math.
 The pricing logic must follow a strict, documented sequence, and the output must include a human-readable audit trail explaining how every amount was calculated.
 Given the same input, the engine must always produce the same output.
