            "problem_statement": "We need to build a small rule-checking module that decides whether an action is allowed or blocked at a given time.
The decision is based on a set of predefined rules that may overlap and can be either weekly recurring rules or fixed date-range rules.

The system must resolve overlapping rules deterministically using a strict and documented precedence order.
In addition to returning the final decision, the module must also explain why that decision was made in a human-readable way for audit and debugging purposes.

The key challenge is not performance, but correctness, determinism, and strict adherence to the specification. Any ambiguity, hidden assumption, or behavior drift is considered incorrect.
