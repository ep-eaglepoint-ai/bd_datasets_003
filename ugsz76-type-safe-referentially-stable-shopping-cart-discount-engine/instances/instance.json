            "problem_statement": "Design a deterministic shopping cart discount utility in TypeScript that applies a percentage discount only to line items where isEligible(item) returns true. The function must never mutate the input cart or any nested objects. It must preserve referential identity (===) for every unchanged line item, price, metadata, and nested field, and only create new objects along the exact changed path. For discounted items, store the pre-discount amount in originalAmountCents, ensure idempotency (reapplying the same discount does not change references), reconcile incorrect discounted amounts when originalAmountCents exists, and use half-up rounding away from zero (including negatives). No external libraries, spreads, or cloning utilities.",
