4.3×10^19, making naive Breadth-First Search (BFS) computationally impossible due to memory exhaustion. The engineering challenge is to implement Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) combined with an admissible heuristic function derived from pre-computed Pattern Databases (Manhattan distance of corners/edges) to prune the search tree. Mid-tier models frequently default to the "Human Layer-by-Layer" method, which produces suboptimal move counts (>50), or implement standard BFS, which hangs indefinitely on scrambles requiring more than 6 moves.",
