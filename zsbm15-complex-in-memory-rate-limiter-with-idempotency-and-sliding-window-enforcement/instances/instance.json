            "problem_statement": "The task is to implement an in-memory rate limiter for a hotel booking API that enforces dual sliding-window limits: a global per-user limit and a per-user per-route limit. Each request must be deterministically allowed or denied based on cost-based usage within a strict time window, while supporting request retries (idempotency), route-specific costs, and out-of-order timestamps. The implementation must use only standard Python libraries, operate purely in memory, and avoid mutating caller-provided inputs. Correct handling of sliding-window boundaries, request ordering, and retry behavior is required for downstream systems to trust the limiter’s decisions.
