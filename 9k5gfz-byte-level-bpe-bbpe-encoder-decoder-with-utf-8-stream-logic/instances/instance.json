            "problem_statement": "The fundamental distinction between standard BPE and Byte-Level BPE is the shift from character-based processing to raw UTF-8 byte stream manipulation. Mid-tier models frequently fail to decompose multi-byte Unicode characters (such as Emojis) into their constituent integers, treating them instead as atomic string tokens, which violates the zero-UNK requirement. Additionally, the encoding process demands a strict, priority-driven greedy merge strategy; failing to respect the exact order of the merge list results in nondeterministic tokenization that breaks the lossless reversibility guarantee required by the decoder.",
