            "problem_statement": "Implement a comprehensive set of unit tests for a token bucket–based rate limiter written in Go. The rate limiter restricts the number of allowed requests within a fixed time window by issuing and consuming tokens. Each request consumes a token if available; once all tokens are exhausted, further requests are rejected until tokens are refilled. The rate limiter supports token refilling based on elapsed time and allows injection of a custom time source.  The goal is to validate the core rate-limiting behavior, ensure correct token refill logic over time, and verify accurate tracking of token consumption.",
