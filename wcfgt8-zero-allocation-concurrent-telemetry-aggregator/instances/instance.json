The current Go implementation has memory leaks and data loss during peak traffic due to faulty buffer management and unrecycled object pools. A redesign is required to guarantee zero memory growth after warm-up, implement a true 90% capacity circuit breaker with backpressure, and provide atomic aggregation for configurable time windows. The system must sustain 100,000 events/second with sub-millisecond P99 latency.",
