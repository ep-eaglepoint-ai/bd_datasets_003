            "problem_statement": "We need to validate a high-throughput log aggregation system under concurrent load, ensuring correct behavioral, ordering, isolation, and performance guarantees. The system must preserve per-source order, flush logs by severity without mixing, trigger flushes by size or time, handle slow flushes without blocking others, maintain non-blocking submission latency, operate correctly under sustained high load, detect race conditions, and flush remaining entries on stop. Tests must be black-box, rely on observable outcomes, and tolerate nondeterministic scheduling.
