            "problem_statement": "The task evaluates two independently written Vitest test suites designed to validate a static analyzer for feature flag rules. The analyzer is expected to detect invalid rules, contradictions, redundancies, shadowed rules, and ambiguous overlaps while guaranteeing immutability, determinism, and stable ordering.
 The goal of this evaluation is to assess whether the test suites correctly and robustly enforce the specified requirements without overfitting to a single implementation or relying on assumptions not explicitly required. The grading focuses on identifying gaps where tests either fail to validate critical invariants or enforce overly strict, implementation-specific behavior that would incorrectly fail valid solutions.
