            "problem_statement": "we have a tool that scans source code for calls to a translation function, identifies missing keys in a JSON resource file, and synchronizes them using a mockable translation service. However, there are concerns regarding the tool's thread safety during concurrent scans, its handling of complex string escape sequences, and its ability to merge data without destroying existing manual translations. You must author a comprehensive test suite to audit this logic and identify potential regressions in its state management and file-processing pipeline.",
