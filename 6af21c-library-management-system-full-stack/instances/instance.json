The previous paper-based and spreadsheet-based system caused:
Inconsistent book availability data
Books appearing as “available” when already borrowed
Conflicts when multiple librarians processed loans at the same time
Missing or incorrect borrowing history
The library now needs a reliable, concurrent-safe web application to manage books and borrowing activity.
