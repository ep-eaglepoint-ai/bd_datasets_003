            "problem_statement": "A developer platform currently uses JWT tokens for authentication, but enterprise customers are requesting programmatic API access with usage tracking and rate limits. The existing system has no way to issue API keys, track per-key usage, or enforce tier-based request limits. 

Customers report they cannot integrate the platform into their CI/CD pipelines without hardcoding user credentials, which is a security risk. The platform needs to support both authentication methods simultaneously without breaking existing JWT-based integrations. Core files include app.js, models/User.js, and schema.sql, with Redis available for rate limiting and PostgreSQL for persistent storage.",
