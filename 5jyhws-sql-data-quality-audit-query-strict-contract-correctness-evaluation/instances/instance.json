We need a single, read-only SQL audit query that detects data quality violations in a legacy PostgreSQL database where foreign key constraints and strict validations are not enforced at the schema level.

The query must identify common integrity issues (orphan records, invalid statuses, impossible amounts, inconsistent timestamps, and duplicate natural keys) and return a standardized, deterministic report suitable for automated checks, dashboards, and alerting.

This task intentionally tests spec discipline, not just SQL correctness.
Any deviation from the required output format, logic semantics, or edge-case handling is considered a failure.
