            "problem_statement": "The customer support platform's existing chat implementation cannot scale beyond a single server instance, causing message delivery failures when load balancers route customers and agents to different backend servers. Customers report losing messages after brief network interruptions because the system has no reconnection recovery mechanism. Support managers discovered that during traffic spikes, two customers sometimes get assigned to the same agent simultaneously, exceeding the agent's configured chat limit. The WebSocket server's memory usage grows continuously until it crashes, and thread dumps show thousands of goroutines stuck in send operations. Core logic is in hub.go, client.go, and agent_router.go.",
