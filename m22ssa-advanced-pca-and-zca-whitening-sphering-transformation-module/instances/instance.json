            "problem_statement": "Implement a numerically stable whitening (sphering) transformation in Python that converts correlated feature data into an uncorrelated space with unit variance. The system must support both PCA whitening and ZCA whitening, follow a reusable fit/transform API suitable for machine-learning pipelines, and handle real-world issues such as ill-conditioned covariance matrices, dimensionality reduction, and inversion back to the original feature space.",
