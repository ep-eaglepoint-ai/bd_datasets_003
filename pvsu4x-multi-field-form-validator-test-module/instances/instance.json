The validator checks if the username, email, and password fields meet strict requirements. Previous manual testing missed edge cases, leading to invalid registrations. Your task is to design a Python unit test file using the unittest library that verifies the behavior of the validate_form function, ensuring it properly validates the form fields and handles various edge cases.",
