            "problem_statement": "Build a minimalist gratitude journaling app with Remix and TypeScript that presents a calm, focused interface for daily reflection on three grateful items, auto‑saves entries, and allows browsing past entries. Use SQLite/Prisma ORM for data, generate word‑clouds of recurring themes, and implement “On this day” reminders showing previous years’ entries. The application must provide a distraction‑free writing experience, gentle prompts, and meaningful reflection tools to encourage consistent positive journaling.
