            "problem_statement": "A naive parking system iterates through an array of spots to find the first free slot. This is O(N)
linear time. In a facility with 100,000 spots, a linear scan creates a locking bottleneck that freezes the system during peak hours. The engineering solution requires maintaining a Min-Heap of free spot IDs. Allocation becomes an O(log⁡N) "Pop Min" operation, and Deallocation becomes an O(log⁡N)"Push" operation. The specific trap is the concurrency control: if the Heap state is not protected by a Mutex during the Pop/Push cycle, two threads will grab the same "Root" node (Spot ID 0), resulting in a double-booking collision.",
