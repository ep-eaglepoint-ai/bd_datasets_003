            "problem_statement": "The system receives batches of trip status events from drivers’ mobile apps. Due to unreliable networks, events can arrive late, out of order, duplicated, or with missing/inconsistent fields. You must process events without reordering or modifying input, maintain an isolated in-memory state per driver (current active trip + counters), and produce a per-driver utilization summary. Only valid state transitions should update the driver’s summary; invalid/inconsistent events must be ignored and reported, and must never corrupt driver state or affect other drivers.",
