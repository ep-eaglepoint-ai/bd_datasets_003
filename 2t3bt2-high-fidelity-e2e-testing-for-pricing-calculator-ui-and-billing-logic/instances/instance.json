            "problem_statement": "The SaaS-Growth marketing site includes an interactive Pricing Calculator component that dynamically computes pricing based on seat count and billing period. The component currently lacks automated end-to-end coverage, resulting in regressions such as incorrect totals, NaN values when toggling annual billing on certain browsers, and missed tier transitions when crossing the Pro → Enterprise threshold. The task is to design and implement a comprehensive E2E test suite to validate pricing logic, accessibility compliance, visual correctness, and responsive behavior across multiple viewports, ensuring long-term stability and regression prevention.",
