    "problem_statement": "Build a reliable to-do list UI as a legacy React class component that can be embedded into older enterprise React codebases that do not support Hooks. The component must let users add tasks, display them in a list, and remove tasks immediately, while keeping state stable across re-renders during the browser session (in-memory only). The implementation must avoid common legacy pitfalls such as lost this context, direct state mutation, handler rebinding in render, and unnecessary re-renders. It must remain responsive with 100+ items and work correctly with rapid user actions.",
